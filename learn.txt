In the Git sidebar of Visual Studio Code (VSCode), the letters **U**, **A**, and **M** are used to indicate the status of files in your working directory and staging area. Here's what each of these letters stands for:

1. **U** - **Untracked**: This status means that the file is new and has not been added to the version control system yet. Git is not tracking this file.

2. **A** - **Added**: This status indicates that the file has been added to the staging area. It is ready to be committed to the repository.

3. **M** - **Modified**: This status shows that the file has been modified since the last commit and the changes have not yet been staged or committed.

These statuses help you understand the state of your files and manage them accordingly within the version control system. Here's a quick summary of their meanings:

- **U**: Untracked (new file not added to version control)
- **A**: Added (file staged for commit)
- **M**: Modified (file has changes that are not yet staged or committed)
